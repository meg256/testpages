      <h2>Pathogen Genomics Centers of Excellence Network</h2>
      <p>The Pathogen Genomics Centers of Excellence (PGCoE) Network is meant to foster and improve innovation and technical capacity in pathogen genomics, molecular epidemiology, and bioinformatics to better prevent, control, and respond to microbial threats of public health importance. The network also represents an unprecedented opportunity to expand and deepen collaboration between U.S. public health agencies and academic institutions to form a national resource to better prevent, control, and respond to microbial threats of public health importance.</p>
