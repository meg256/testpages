        <h2>Data and Visualization Resources</h2>
        <p>In outbreak situations, it is often necessary to move quickly, especially to answer important questions about where an pathogen outbreak may be coming from, how it's spreading, and if the pathogen itself is changing as it spreads. To facilitate rapid response, the The Pathogen Genomics Centers of Excellence (PGCoE) Network is engaged in efforts to develop and share standardized databases and code repositories focused on analysis and visualization of pathogen genomic data and associated metadata.<p>

        <h3>State-Focused Nextstrain Builds from Washington State</h3>
        <p><a href="https://nwpage.org/"><img style="display:inline-block; height:1em; width:auto; transform:translate(0, 0.1em)" src="img/icon_square-NW.png"></a> <a href="https://nextstrain.org/groups/wadoh">State-focused builds</a> refer to Nextstrain analyses where data inclusion is designed to provide high visibility into disease dynamics in a jurisdiction of interest, such as a state. This sampling frame stands in contrast to the broader, representatively sampled datasets typically created by the Nextstrain team. The <a href="https://nextstrain.org/groups/wadoh">linked</a> builds are specific to Washington state, but can be forked to provide a template to users wishing to make their own Nextstrain analyses focusing on their particular jurisdiction of interest.</p>
