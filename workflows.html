        <p>The Pathogen Genomics Centers of Excellence (PGCoE) Network is currently conducting a viral respiratory benchmarking study, which aims to compare the results of pathogen genome assembly workflows used across the United States. When complete, the bioinformatics workflows listed below will be annotated according to their applicability for different sequencing platforms and effectiveness for specific pathogens. Further information on this benchmarking study, including details about the tool we are using to evaluate sequencing results, are available <a href="https://github.com/pgcoe/benchmarking">here</a>.</p>
