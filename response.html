        <h2>Responding to Emerging Pathogen Threats</h2>
        <p>The PGCoE Network also leads efforts to create the technical and social unification necessary to enable nimble, coordinated work between partners when generating and using sequence data as during an infectious disease event. This work ensures we have consistent ways of generating and capturing genomic and metadata, methods for sharing and/or collating across states, jurisdictions, and institutions, and protocols for how we communicate and work together during an infectious disease response.</p>

        <h2>Roadmap for Building Genomic Epidemiology Capacity</h2>
        <p>Looking to build genomics-informed response capacity?</p>
        <p>We’ve developed a roadmap of what expertise, capabilities, and infrastructure is necessary to support sustained, routine application of pathogen genomics to public health questions. These are the essential elements necessary to support effective genomic surveillance and actionable genomic epidemiological inferences.</p>
