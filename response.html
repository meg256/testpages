        <h2>Responding to Emerging Pathogen Threats</h2>
        <p>The PGCoE Network also leads efforts to create the technical and social unification necessary to enable nimble, coordinated work between partners when generating and using sequence data as during an infectious disease event. This work ensures we have consistent ways of generating and capturing genomic and metadata, methods for sharing and/or collating across states, jurisdictions, and institutions, and protocols for how we communicate and work together during an infectious disease response.</p>

        <h2>Roadmap for Building Genomic Epidemiology Capacity</h2>
        <div class="outer">
            <p>Looking to build genomics-informed response capacity?</p>
            <p>We've developed a roadmap of what expertise, capabilities, and infrastructure is necessary to support sustained, routine application of pathogen genomics to public health questions. These are the essential elements necessary to support effective genomic surveillance and actionable genomic epidemiological inferences.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing Resources</h2>
        <div class="outer">
            <p>The PGCoE Network is tackling big challenges in data sharing in several ways, including the development of data sharing templates and metadata specifications for genomic epidemiology endpoints. These documents and templates will be linked here when available. </p>

        <h2>Genomic Analysis Visualization Library</h2>
        <div class="outer">
            <p>In outbreak situations, it is often necessary to move quickly, especially to answer important questions about where an pathogen outbreak may be coming from, how it's spreading, and if the pathogen itself is changing as it spreads. To facilitate rapid deployment and visualization of these analyses, the PGCoE Network is building a Genomic Analysis Visualization Library. This library will include key analyses that should be performed to answer specific questions often asked during pathogen outbreaks, as well as code snippets that can be used to perform these analyses given a standardized set of input data. Together, these code snippets can form the basis of a situational report suitable for deployment in emergency situations of multiple pathogens. The Visualization Library will be linked here when complete.</p>
